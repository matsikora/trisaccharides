= How To Use NAMD with AMBER Output Topologies From ACPYPE =

== Introduction ==

This tutorial is to show how to prepare a system to run on NAMD, starting
with a PDB file for a complex protein/ligand.

It is a mere proof of concept.
If you have suggestions about how to improve this tutorial, please send a
comment (at the bottom of the page).

For this tutorial I use [http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd NAMD]. It is free
and works fine with AMBER input files, however with some caveats:

    * Polarizable parameters in AMBER are not supported.
    * NAMD does not support the 10-12 potential terms in some old AMBER versions. When non-zero 10-12 parameter is encountered in PARM file, NAMD will terminate.
    * NAMD has several exclusion policy options, defined by `exclude`. The way AMBER dealing with exclusions corresponds to the "scaled1-4" in NAMD. So for simulations using AMBER force field, one would specify "exclude scaled1-4" in the configuration file, and set `1-4scaling` to the inverse value of SCEE as would be used in AMBER.
    * NAMD does not read periodic box lengths in PARM or coordinate file. They must be explicitly specified in NAMD configuration file.
    * By default, NAMD applies switching functions to the non-bond interactions within the cutoff distance, which helps to improve energy conservation, while AMBER does not use switching functions so it simply truncates the interactions at cutoff. However, if "authentic" AMBER cutoff simulations are desired, the switching functions could be turned off by specifying "switching off" in NAMD configuration file.
    * NAMD and AMBER may have different default values for some parameters (e.g., the tolerance of SHAKE). One should check [http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/2.6/ug/node15.html NAMD manual] for accurate descriptions of the NAMD options.

*NB:* One doesn't really need *acpype*, only *antechamber* to do it, but I
believe *acpype* makes this chore easier.

== Running an Example ==

This is for protein 1BVG.pdb (get it at [http://www.pdb.org PDB]), a homodimer
(HIV protease) with a ligand called DMP. We will use force field Amber99SB.

Luckily, this pdb file has all hydrogens for the ligand, which is necessary for
*antechamber*. One can use either, e.g., `babel -h _mol_w/o_H_.pdb _mol_with_H.pdb`
or [http://www.yasara.org YASARA View] to automatically add missing hydrogens to
your compound. The former just puts 'H' for atom names while the latter puts
more meaningful atom name, e.g., 'HCA' for a H bonded to a CA and not a simply
 'H' as *babel* does.

In a script-like way:
{{{

Now, using *acpype* to convert directly from AMBER to GROMACS

{{{
acpype -p ComplexAmber.prmtop -x ComplexAmber.inpcrd

Voila!

====NOTE====
    * I am trying to set up here the same simulation conditions as in [TutorialAcpype4Gromacs], althought NAMD system ended up with 30 atoms of water more and it runs in double precision while GROMACS in single precision.
    * GROMACS is much faster than NAMD in my Mac Intel Duo Core 2Ghz:
        * 1 proc.: 694%
        * 2 proc.: 624%
    * But NAMD scales better when using 2 proc.:
        * gain of 80% for NAMD
        * gain of 64% for GROMACS

Let's wait for and see GROMACS 4.
