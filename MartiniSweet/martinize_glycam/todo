Idea: Martinize for carbohydrates and glycoproteins with
         - no need for pre-martinize
         - novel structures (monosaccharides and linkage need to be known)
         - output that facilitates later automatized parameter optimization
         
Assumption: - The bonded interactions (bonds, angles, dihedrals, exclusions) of a given sugar in a glycan sequence *only* depend
              on the sugar identity and the substitution sites, but not on the actual glycan sequence. 
              This is an analogous assumption to the case of proteins where amino acid parameters do not change with protein 
              context either.
              
- Input: GLYCAM-formatted pdb (required) 
         a mapping scheme (triangular vs. polymeric) (optional)   
         MARTINI force field
         
- Strategy: 
    Use latest martinize.py 2.6 as starting point and incorporate premartinize 

    Loop through sugars from reducing end (or amino acid linkage)
      - Identify sugars (e.g. beta-D-Gal) and their substitution (1,4) from LINK section
      - Look up mapping (say C1, C2, O2 => SP1, C3, O3, C4, O4 => SP4, etc.) and topology (internal and external bonds,
        angles, dihedrals, exclusions) according to chosen mapping scheme and force field and substitution
      - Write topology with comments allowing for later automatized parameter optimization on the itp file
        (maybe like 
                # bonds
                1  2   0.340 4000 ; 4YB 1-2
